# Overview
This document is intended to provide the quickest path to a fully functional
development environment for developers planning to contribute to the Check-Ins
project using MacOS.

# Install Homebrew
For complete information on using Homebrew, visit https://brew.sh

The fastest path to installing Homebrew is to run the following from the command line in your terminal window:
```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

## Shell Completions
For the most recent instructions for enabling command shell auto-completions,
see the [Homebrew Shell Completion Instructions](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Shell-Completion.md)
for [bash](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Shell-Completion.md#configuring-completions-in-bash),
[zsh](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Shell-Completion.md#configuring-completions-in-zsh), and
[fish](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Shell-Completion.md#configuring-completions-in-fish)

# Install Git
From the commandline run:
```shell
git --version
```
If git is not yet installed on your Mac, you will be prompted to install the XCode command line tools.

Alternatively, you can install git via Homebrew:
```shell
brew install git
```
## Install Hub
Since this project is hosted on GitHub, using [Hub](https://github.com/github/hub) will make many common tasks more
convenient. You can install hub via Homebrew:
```shell
brew install hub
```
### Create a git alias (optional)
If your default shell is zsh (OSX Default) then add the following line to your `~/zshrc` file. For bash, add the line to
your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file.
```shell
alias git=hub
```

## SSH Keys
If you haven't already, you will want to [configure git to use ssh for connecting to GitHub.](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

# Install OpenJDK
Install OpenJDK 14 with Homebrew:
```shell
brew cask install AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk/adoptopenjdk14
```

# Install jEnv
jEnv is a version manager for the JDK. It can be installed with Homebrew by running the following on the command line:
```shell
brew install jenv
```
As instructed in the `==> Caveats` section of the Homebrew installation output, if your default shell is zsh
(OSX Default) then add the following lines to your `~/zshrc` file. For bash, add the lines to your `.bash_profile` or
`.bashrc` file.

```shell
export PATH="$HOME/.jenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(jenv init -)"
```

## Plugins
If your default shell is zsh (OSX Default) then add the following lines to your `~/zshrc` file. For bash, add the lines
to your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file.

```shell
jenv enable-plugin export
jenv enable-plugin gradle
jenv enable-plugin maven
```

## Register JDKs
List your JDKs using:
```shell
/usr/libexec/java_home -V
```
This will produce output similar to:
```shell
Matching Java Virtual Machines (1):
    14.0.2, x86_64:     "AdoptOpenJDK 14"       /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-14.jdk/Contents/Home
```
You can register each JDK with `jenv add <your_jdk_path>`. For example:
```shell
jenv add /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-14.jdk/Contents/Home
```
## Using jEnv
You can list all registered JDKS with:
```shell
jenv versions
```
Set the system-wide Java version by doing:
```shell
jenv global 14.0
```
Set a project-wide Java version by doing:
```shell
jenv local 14.0
```
Set a shell instance Java version by doing:
```shell
jenv shell 14.0
```
# Install NMV
In order to install or update NVM, you need to run the following from the command line:
```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.0/install.sh | bash
```

# Install Yarn
```shell
brew install yarn
```
