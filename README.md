# Check-ins
<a id="markdown-check-ins" name="check-ins"></a>
This web application is written in [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io) for uploading files and tracking skill set of team members. This application will also be used for PDL checkins and to auto-generate resumes from the skill set.

# Project Links
<a id="markdown-project-links" name="project-links"></a>
**Project Document:** \*TBA\*

**Project Board:** [Board](https://github.com/oci-labs/check-ins/projects/1)

**Environments:** \*TBA\*

# Setup
<a id="markdown-setup" name="setup"></a>
There are two files required to run the application successfully. Both of which must be created and placed in
`src/main/resources/secrets`

### directory.json
<a id="markdown-directory-json" name="directory-json"></a>
This is a simple JSON file containing the identifier for the Google Drive folder into which the uploaded files are to be deposited.

```json
{
    "upload-directory-id": "GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID"
}
```

### credentials.json
<a id="markdown-credentials-json" name="credentials-json"></a>
This JSON file should create the generated credentials for a service account that has access to write to the identified Google Drive folder. Information on configuring GCP service account credentials can be [found here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys).

Note: Be sure that the target Google Drive folder has edit access granted to the service account.
